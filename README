* About

 guile-dbi provides a simple, generic, easy-to-use scheme/guile interface
 to SQL databases, such as Postgres or MySQL.

 The system is split into two parts: the DBI (database independent) part,
 which provides the scheme interfaces, and the DBD (database dependent)
 plugins, which connect to the actual SQL server. Currently, there are
 DBD backends for PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite3.

 Please send patches and bug reports to guile-user@gnu.org, and be sure
 to copy Linas Vepstas <linasvepstas@gmail.com>. Alternately, they may
 be posted at bug reports to https://gna.org/bugs/?group=guile-dbi, in
 which case the mailing list should be notified anyway.

* Guile DBI dependencies

   guile dbi depends from this packages, need them to build and run:
	
	Guile: http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/  
		The guile scheme implementation

   Be sure to install both the runtime and the development environment;
   devel is needed to compile guile-dbi.

   Optionally(?)
	Greg:  http://www.gnu.org/software/greg/
		A great test framework.

   A working compiler and build toolchain, etc.

* Compiling

   The standard build tools should work:
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Be sure to also do the above steps for the guile-dbd backends
   you wish to run!

* Testing

  make check

  Requires the greg testing framework, available at 
  http://home.gna.org/greg/

* Guile DBI Documentation

   The doc directory contains the reference manual  and some examples.

   The www pages are at http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-dbi or
   http://home.gna.org/guile-dbi/

   The project page is at: http://www.gna.org/projects/guile-dbi.

* Verifying

   The system is distributed using the normal tar.gz format; it can be
   extracted using the "tar -zxf guile-dbi-2.1.5.tar.gz" command at the
   command line.

   The files have been digitally signed to make sure that there was no
   corruption of the dataset during download, and to help ensure that
   no malicious changes were made to the code internals by third
   parties. The signatures can be checked with the gpg command:

   gpg --verify guile-dbi-2.1.5.tar.gz.asc

   which should generate output identical to (except for the date):

   gpg: Signature made Tue Feb 26 19:41:07 2008 CST using RSA key ID C0389241
   gpg: Good signature from "Linas Vepstas (current active email; others are inactive) <linasvepstas@gmail.com>"
